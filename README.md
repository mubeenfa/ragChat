incorrect startxref pointer(3)
parsing for Object Streams

message isn’t a Python error - when the PDF file is slightly corrupted or not perfectly spec-compliant.
Why this happens

The PDF was generated by a non-standard tool (some scanners/exporters do this).

The file has minor corruption (e.g., from transfer or compression).

It’s a PDF/A or hybrid format with object streams that the parser has trouble reading.


"""
Single-file RAG prototype (local)

Phases:
- Phase 1: Local PDF -> Chroma -> query (retrieval-only)
- Phase 2: Add local LLM to generate responses using retrieved chunks
- Phase 3: Add prompt templates, metadata, and safety checks (cite sources, refuse when context is missing)

Requirements (pip):
pip install chromadb sentence-transformers langchain langchain-community tqdm rich
# optional (recommended) for a local fast LLM (requires a GGML .bin model):
pip install llama-cpp-python
# fallback if you want to use HF transformers locally (may require large models):
pip install transformers accelerate torch

Notes:
- This script assumes small-scale local use.
- If you prefer a different embedding model, change EMBED_MODEL.
- Keep an eye on memory when loading large LLMs locally.
